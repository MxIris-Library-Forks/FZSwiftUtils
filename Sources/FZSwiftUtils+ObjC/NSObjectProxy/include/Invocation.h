/**
 An Objective-C message rendered as an object.
 
 `Inovation` objects contains all elements of an Objective-C message: a target, a selector, arguments, and the return value. Each of these elements can be set directly, and the return value is set automatically when the invocation is dispatched.
 
 They are used to store and forward messages between objects and between applications, primarily by `Timer` objects and the distributed objects system.
 
 An invocation can be repeatedly dispatched to different targets; its arguments can be modified between dispatch for varying results; even its `selector` can be changed to another with the same method signature (argument and return types).
 
 `Inovation` does not support invocations of methods with either variable numbers of arguments or union arguments.
